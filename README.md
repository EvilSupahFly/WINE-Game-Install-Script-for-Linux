## BASH-based Installer Script For WINE - Preamble
This Windows game installer was written in BASH and is designed (originally) to be run on Ubuntu and downstream Ubuntu-based systems (like Mint, for example). At this point, it will fail if this is not the case, though changing that is on my eventual to-do list. This installer assumes you have also downloaded the `.redist` folder and have saved your installer .EXE files in a correspondingly-named subfolder of the folder the script is being run from (see the screenshots for examples).

## Terms Definitions:
 - "script" - the actual BASH script that does all your heavy lifting
 - "installer" - the Windows-based executable file (frequently named "setup.exe") distributed by the game developers or distributor

## Explanation and disclaimer
The script is bound by some limitations at this point, and while it does offer explanations for what it's doing at each step along the way, it's not fool-proof and assumes a base level of experience and systemic understanding from its user. Also, since it was originally intended to work for games downloaded from GoG, and even ripped directly from physical media, it employs a basic assumed-naming convention for the sake of simplicity and usability in that the default location will always be `C:\Games\${SOURCE_FOLDER_NAME}\`. While "The Game 2" or "The Game - II" are both valid ways of naming the source folder since the script relies on the user to store the initial setup file(s) in a somewhat sensibly named location, this can be overridden with the installer's built-in "Advanced Options" should the convention employed by this script not be used as the default by the installer. If, for example, you saved "setup.exe" in folder "The Game 2", the script creates the folder `C:\Games\The Game 2\` but then you see that the installer wants to install your game to `C:\Games\The Game II\`, so you pull up the advanced options and change the path accordingly.

## Getting Started
For launching, there are several options:

    1. ./install.sh
    2. ./install skip
    3. ./install "Some Folder"
    4. ./install "Some Folder" skip

In the first instance, the script will read in a list of all the directories present under the one it's being run from. Useful if you can't remember where you saved the installer .EXE or if you just don't feel like typing more than the minimum required to make this work.

In the second instance, using "skip" allows you to bypass the MSVC prompt.

The third instance skips the directory listing and just gives you a list of .EXE files in "Some Folder", prompting you to pick one.

The last option combines the second and third choices, skipping the directory listing, and skipping the MSVC prompt.

This script will also attempt to ascertain whether or not WINE is installed. If it can't find the official WINE respositories listed in any .source files, and WINE doesn't appear to be installed, the script will attempt to add the official repositories and install both WINE and WINETRICKS.

Assuming a WINE install can be verified, the script will create a WINEPREFIX and a "destination" folder for the game, and offer you the choice to skip installing the MSVC Redistributables from the `.redist` folder. If you say "no", the script will call WINE to sequentially run any .EXE files it finds. If you say "yes", it will move to the next step. Since this list is dynamic, new versions of the MSVC can be added as they are released without needing to change the installer script.

At this point, the script looks for any .EXE files in the source directory (either chosen from the menu or supplied on the command-line), present a list, ask you to pick one, then call WINE to run it.

Next, we install the newest release of Vulkan from [JC141's Vulkan repository](https://github.com/jc141x/vulkan) to replace DX11, and once the initial "setup" completes in WINE, the script looks for any .EXE files in the "destination" folder, once again presenting a user-selectable list.

With the final .EXE selected, this script writes a runner script for the chosen game which defines the WINEPREFIX and game install location, and the name of the game's primary .EXE, makes it executable, and reports all this to the user.
